install maven and docker
all jobs are started with jenkins user

do step 3 and 5 from following url, remember $user is jenkins: https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/quickstart

Before you can push or pull images, you must configure Docker to use the gcloud command-line tool to 
authenticate requests to Container Registry. To do so, run the following command (you are only required to do this once):
gcloud auth configure-docker

We need to generate ssh keys using jenkins user and add it to webapp machine known hosts, so we can connect to 
webapp machine to perform some operation
ssh vinirmititemp2@webapp

bitbucket repository settings > Access keys

you may also need to install npm & nodejs (preferably 8.x)
also :: npm install -g @angular/cli  :: for ng build --prod to run
